			• Rosa Mystica High School, Kinnikambla, Mangalore (Estd: 1958)
		</h2>
		<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg text-slate-700">
			Rosa Mystica High School was opened in the year 1958. As there was no
			facility for the secondary education of the children of this area, they
			had to travel to distant places like Bajpe or Kulshekar. Hence seeing this
			need, Sr Edburge, who was the Headmistress of the TTI, took the bold
			initiative to start a high school to cater to the educational needs of the
			children, especially those who pass out of Rosa Mystica Higher Primary
			School. So, 20th June 1958 became a red-letter day in the annals of Rosa
			Mystica as the High School was opened on this day.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg text-slate-700">
			In 1966, co-education was started. Rosa Mystica High School, with three
			sections in each, had the strength of 420 students. With the hard work of
			all Headmistresses and the committed services of the staff, the high
			school saw all-round development in the later years. In the year 2008, the
			Golden Jubilee of the school was celebrated.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg text-slate-700">
			The Headmistresses who served this institute are Sr Edburge BS, Sr Mithis
			BS, Sr Mariette BS, Sr Valentine BS, Sr Mediatrice BS, Sr Helmina BS, Sr
			Donalda BS, Sr Cicilia Mendonca, Sr Marie Ange BS, Sr Gloriosa BS, Sr
			Ivilla BS, Sr Vidya BS, Sr Joyceline BS, and currently Sr Lolita Pereira
			BS.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg text-slate-700">
			This institute has special blessings of Saint Teresa of Calcutta, who paid
			a visit to Rosa Mystica on 29th December 1980. In her address, she spoke
			about religious vocation and her concern about the poor in India and our
			duty to serve them.

			Rosa Mystica Higher Primary School is the fruit of the far-sighted vision
			of the Servant of God Mgr. R.F.C Mascarenhas, the Founder of Bethany
			Congregation. It took its birth in 1939, a small step taken by Bethany,
			which has gone a long way in changing the face of Rosa Mystica as the
			school plays a vital role in catering to the all-round development and
			welfare of the students of backward classes and in the fulfillment of the
			vision, goal, and core values of Bethany Educational Society.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg text-slate-700">
			Currently, there are 625 Students with 11 Staff and 4 Substitute Teachers.
			They cater to the rural poor and the marginalized of the locality and
			others as well. The opportunities for the blooming of the students,
			including Karate, art, band, clubs, and bull-bull classes, are provided.
			The Headmistress, along with its staff, strives towards fullness of life
			imbued with the core values of Bethany Educational Society. While doing
			this, it aims at becoming an effective agent for the transformation of
			society.
