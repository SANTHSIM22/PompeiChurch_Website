		history: `The Gurpur Parish is situated 19 km from Mangalore on the Mangalore-Moodbidri road. The parish is also known as Kowdur, but it is designated in the registered Diocesan Directory as Gurpur Parish. It is commonly referred to as Kowdur because, in the Kowdur ward of the parish, there is a place called ‘Kodi’, where a spring of water flows in all seasons. Hence, the location was named Kodi-ooru or Kowdur. It is said that since this location of Kowdur was near the present Church, it was named Kowdur Parish. According to the revenue department's classification, the parish belongs to the Gurpur zone, and most of the parishioners reside in this area; therefore, the parish is recognized under the name Gurpur. <br><br>

		The church land structure is located in a village called ‘Kandavar’. Apart from Kowdur, the villages of Mulur, Badaga, Ulipadi, Paduperar, Mooduperar, Kolambe, Gurpur, and Addur are included within the area of Gurpur Parish. Geographically, the area of the parish is characterized by numerous fields and hills. To the south of the parish flows the Gurpur River, whose sand is famous in Mangalore city. Part of the parish area consists of rocky terrain. <br><br>

		The most common occupations of the people in this area include the cultivation of cashews, areca nuts, and flowers. In addition, many people are engaged in both large-scale and small-scale industries. A significant number of families from this parish are employed in foreign countries and metropolitan cities across the nation, which has positively impacted the economic condition of the parish. <br><br>

		Before the establishment of Gurpur Parish, the families living in this locality belonged to Fezar Parish. The people of Gurpur would attend the Ferar Church for Eucharistic celebrations and spiritual benefits. The population was doubling each year, creating an urgent need for new parishes to accommodate such rapid growth.<br><br>

		On October 7, 1915, Parish Priest Rev. Fr. Reginald Pinto laid the foundation for the chapel. The building was completed by Fr. J. M. Menezes and blessed by Rt. Rev. Bishop Paul Ferini S. J. on October 29, 1918. In the Diocese of Mangalore, this parish is uniquely dedicated to Our Lady of Pompei. A holy picture of the image of Our Lady of Pompei was brought from a city called ‘Pompei’ in Italy and was honored in this parish. Due to the number of miracles attributed to Our Lady of Pompei, the once-barren Kowdur has blossomed like a beautiful garden in God’s vineyard.`,

		priestInfo: `<br><strong>Rev. Fr. Reginald Pinto</strong><br>
		Father Reginald Pinto served as the first parish priest and laid the foundation for the church. The cornerstone was blessed and placed by Bishop Perrin on October 7, 1915. The parishioners gathered in large numbers for the event, making it a memorable occasion. <br><br>

		<strong>Rev. Fr. J. M. Menezes</strong><br><br>

		<b><i>Role of Missionaries in building a spiritual community:</i></b><br>

		<strong>Rev. Fr. A. A. E. Colaco (1921 - 1922)</strong><br>
		Fr. A. A. E. Colaco was appointed as the first pastor of the newly constituted parish of Our Lady of Pompei. During his tenure, he established a primary school for the poor and those in need within the parish. <br><br>

		<strong>Rev. Fr. F. X. Nazreth (1922 - 1930) </strong><br>
		He was a convincing preacher of God’s word. During his tenure, he built a church façade using Goan design. In 1925, the church compound wall was constructed, and in 1929, a church bell, which was brought from Goa, was placed on the façade. <br><br>

		<strong>Rev. Fr. Raphel Pinto (1930 - 1933) </strong><br>
		Rev. Fr. Nazreth was succeeded by Rev. Fr. Raphel Pinto. In 1931, he constructed a parochial house. In 1933, Rev. Fr. Antony F. Covelho and Rev. Fr. Denis Mathias served the church. <br><br>

		<strong>Rev. Fr. Aveline Rebello (1933 - 1940) </strong><br>
		He instituted a wooden artistic altar of the Blessed Mother, which was donated by Hospet Church and carved and designed in the Goan style, and it was erected in the center of the church. To commemorate 150 years of Tippu’s bondage on Canara Christians, a cross was placed near the church in a prominent location in 1934. This cross is said to be visible from a long distance, and even today, it reflects the Christian symbol. In 1937, a portico was added to the parish building.  <br><br>

		<strong>Rev. Fr. A. J. Nazreth (1940 - 1948) </strong><br>
		He was like the leaven in bread or a hidden catalyst, whose presence inspired many to devote their lives to the Lord. He also constructed the road leading to the church. <br><br>

		<strong>Rev. Fr. John Castelino (1948 - 1955) </strong><br>
		With deep faith in God and filial trust in our Blessed Mother, he plunged into the work of creating a parish. He also repaired the structure of the church.<br><br>

		<strong>Rev. Fr. J. S. T. Rodrigues (1955 - 1971) </strong><br>
		He was a man of vision and deeply rooted in prayer. His dedicated service was remarkable. He constructed a new building for the primary school, renovated the façade of the church bell, and built a grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes. He invited the Sisters of the Little Flower of Bethany, Mangalore, to serve the parish. As a lover of Karnatic music, he sowed the seeds of music among the people of the parish. He trained children to participate in competitions held at the diocesan level for many years, often securing first place. He took a keen interest in promoting vocations for the religious life and priesthood. The good example he set through his own priestly life, his vigilant oversight, and the timely advice he provided to many young men undoubtedly inspired numerous vocations to the priesthood among the men of the parish where he served. <br><br>

		<strong>Rev. Fr. Bernard D’Souza (1971 - 1972) </strong><br>
		During his B.Ed. studies, he was appointed as a parish priest for a year. With his democratic personality and inspiring sermons, he became a beloved priest to the prisoners. Even as a young priest, he was sought after as a preacher and homilist on important occasions.<br><br>

		<strong>Rev. Fr. Stanly Pereira (1983 - 1991) </strong><br>
		He was a God-fearing priest, and devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary was a special characteristic of Father Pereira. He was deeply committed to making Mary known and loved. The Marian Year of 1954 held particular significance for him, as he wanted to ensure it was recognized and cherished, especially by his own parishioners. During this year, he organized processions and conducted meetings at the ward level. <br><br>

		<strong>Rev. Fr. Leo Veigas (1991 - 1998) </strong><br>
		An active parish priest was transferred from the Bidar Mission Station to this parish. The depth of his interior life was reflected in his attitude toward prayer and various activities within the parish. His zeal was remarkable, and his efforts extended far beyond the confines of his parish. He genuinely cared for the entire community, making him a beloved figure among the parishioners. He worked diligently to combat alcoholism in families through counseling and guidance, fostering an atmosphere of spiritual awareness through retreats and B.C.C. meetings. Under his able and dynamic leadership, an attractive and spacious temple of God was built in commemoration of the parish's Platinum Jubilee. He also advocated for the downtrodden, the sick, and victims of natural disasters.<br><br>

		<strong>Rev. Fr. Cyprian Pinto (1998 - 2005)</strong><br>
		He was a young and energetic priest who became the parish priest in 1998. With his dynamic and active approach, he won the hearts of children, youth, and the elderly alike. After his arrival in this parish, the buildings and institutions became vibrant, demonstrating that not only had the "dry bones been covered with sinews and filled with life," but that the parish also stood out, "decked like a beautiful, young bride." His achievements are remarkable for the parish. As the shepherd of the flock entrusted to him, his concern for spiritual welfare led him to plan regular retreats, sermons, and spiritual guidance, without regard for the time and energy he had to invest. His quiet charity toward the sick and the poor often came at a personal cost and sacrifice. He is known for his meaningful sermons and is commonly referred to as the "Retreat Preacher," having preached over 100 retreats to various parishes. He is soft-spoken, God-fearing, loving, and stands firmly against injustice. To uplift the poor and marginalized, he took a keen interest in enhancing the infrastructure of the Hr. Pry. School through computer education and midday meals. He deserves credit for building the "Pompei Sabha Bhavana" and the church "Dwara." In light of all the achievements of our zealous priest, the parishioners concluded, "It is impossible to enumerate all that you have done for this parish." To name just a few of his contributions: the Altar Servers’ sodality, sodalities for men, women, boys, girls, and the St. Vincent de Paul Society, among others.<br><br>

		<strong>Rev. Fr. Gregory Serrao (2012 - 2015)</strong><br>
