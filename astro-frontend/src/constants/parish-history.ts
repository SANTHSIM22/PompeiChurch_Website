		'The Gurpur Parish is situated at a distance of 19 K.M. from Mangalore on Mangalore-Moodbidri road. The parish is locally known as Kowdur. The Church land structure is located at a village called ‘Kandavar’. Apart from Kowdur, Mulur, Badaga, Ulipadi, Paduperar, Mooduperar, Kolambe, Gurpur, Addur villages are covered under the area of Gurpur Parish. To describe the parish geographically, the area of the parish is covered with a number of fields and hills. To the south of the parish flows the Gurpur River.',
		'Before the existence of the Gurpur parish, the families living in this locality belonged to Fezar parish. After Ferar became a parish in 1912, the people from Gurpur went to Ferar Church for the Eucharistic celebration and also for the spiritual benefits. The number of people was doubling every year and there was an urgent need for new parishes to take care of such rapid growth in population.',

		'On 7th October 1915, Parish Priest of Ferar Rev. Fr. Reginald Pinto laid a foundation for a chapel. The building of the chapel was said to be completed by Fr. Joseph M. Menezes and blessed by Rt. Rev. Bishop Paul Ferini S.J. on October 29, 1918. In the Diocese of Mangalore, only this parish was dedicated to Our Lady of Pompei. A holy picture of the image of Our Lady of Pompei was brought from a city called Pompei in Italy, and is being honored in this parish. Because of the number of miracles and goodness of Our Lady of Pompei, the barren Kowdur has blossomed like a beautiful garden in God’s vineyard.',
