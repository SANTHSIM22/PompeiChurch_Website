        <sup>1</sup> Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High<br>
        will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.<br>
        <sup>2</sup> I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress,
        my God, in whom I trust.”<br>
        <sup>3</sup> Surely he will save you<br>
        from the fowler’s snare<br>
        and from the deadly pestilence.<br>
        <sup>4</sup> He will cover you with his feathers,<br>
        and under his wings you will find refuge;<br>
        his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.<br>
        <sup>5</sup> You will not fear the terror of night,<br>
        nor the arrow that flies by day,<br>
        <sup>6</sup> nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness,<br>
        nor the plague that destroys at midday.<br>
        <sup>7</sup> A thousand may fall at your side,<br>
        ten thousand at your right hand,<br>
        but it will not come near you.<br>
        <sup>8</sup> You will only observe with your eyes<br>
        and see the punishment of the wicked.<br>
        <sup>9</sup> If you say, “The Lord is my refuge,”<br>
        and you make the Most High your dwelling,<br>
        <sup>10</sup> no harm will overtake you,<br>
        no disaster will come near your tent.<br>
        <sup>11</sup> For he will command his angels concerning you<br>
        to guard you in all your ways;<br>
        <sup>12</sup> they will lift you up in their hands,<br>
        so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.<br>
        <sup>13</sup> You will tread on the lion and the cobra;<br>
        you will trample the great lion and the serpent.<br>
        <sup>14</sup> “Because he loves me,” says the Lord, “I will rescue him;<br>
        I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name.<br>
        <sup>15</sup> He will call on me, and I will answer him;<br>
        I will be with him in trouble,<br>
        I will deliver him and honor him.<br>
        <sup>16</sup> With long life I will satisfy him<br>
        and show him my salvation.`,
