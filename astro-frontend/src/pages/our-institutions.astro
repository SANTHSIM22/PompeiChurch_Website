						• Rosa Mystica High School, Kinnikambla, Mangalore (Estd: 1958)
					</h2>
					<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg text-slate-700">
						Rosa Mystica High School was opened in the year 1958. As there was
						no facility for the secondary education of the children of this
						area, they had to travel to distant places like Bajpe or Kulshekar.
						Hence seeing this need, Sr Edburge, who was the Headmistress of the
						TTI, took the bold initiative to start a high school to cater to the
						educational needs of the children, especially those who pass out of
						Rosa Mystica Higher Primary School. So, 20th June 1958 became a
						red-letter day in the annals of Rosa Mystica as the High School was
						opened on this day.
					</p>
					<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg text-slate-700">
						In 1966, co-education was started. Rosa Mystica High School, with
						three sections in each, had the strength of 420 students. With the
						hard work of all Headmistresses and the committed services of the
						staff, the high school saw all-round development in the later years.
						In the year 2008, the Golden Jubilee of the school was celebrated.
					</p>
					<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg text-slate-700">
						The Headmistresses who served this institute are Sr Edburge BS, Sr
						Mithis BS, Sr Mariette BS, Sr Valentine BS, Sr Mediatrice BS, Sr
						Helmina BS, Sr Donalda BS, Sr Cicilia Mendonca, Sr Marie Ange BS, Sr
						Gloriosa BS, Sr Ivilla BS, Sr Vidya BS, Sr Joyceline BS, and
						currently Sr Lolita Pereira BS.
					</p>
					<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg text-slate-700">
						This institute has special blessings of Saint Teresa of Calcutta,
						who paid a visit to Rosa Mystica on 29th December 1980. In her
						address, she spoke about religious vocation and her concern about
						the poor in India and our duty to serve them.

						Rosa Mystica Higher Primary School is the fruit of the far-sighted
						vision of the Servant of God Mgr. R.F.C Mascarenhas, the Founder of
						Bethany Congregation. It took its birth in 1939, a small step taken
						by Bethany, which has gone a long way in changing the face of Rosa
						Mystica as the school plays a vital role in catering to the
						all-round development and welfare of the students of backward
						classes and in the fulfillment of the vision, goal, and core values
						of Bethany Educational Society.
					</p>
					<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg text-slate-700">
						Currently, there are 625 Students with 11 Staff and 4 Substitute
						Teachers. They cater to the rural poor and the marginalized of the
						locality and others as well. The opportunities for the blooming of
						the students, including Karate, art, band, clubs, and bull-bull
						classes, are provided. The Headmistress, along with its staff,
						strives towards fullness of life imbued with the core values of
						Bethany Educational Society. While doing this, it aims at becoming
						an effective agent for the transformation of society.

						The St Camillus congregation, known for serving the sick and the

						Of the 38 patients here currently, 20 are females and the rest are
