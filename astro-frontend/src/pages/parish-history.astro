						<strong>The Gurpur Parish</strong> is situated at a distance of 19 K.M.
						from Mangalore on Mangalore-Moodbidri road. The parish is locally known
						as Kowdur. The Church land structure is located at a village called ‘Kandavar’.
						Apart from Kowdur, Mulur, Badaga, Ulipadi, Paduperar, Mooduperar, Kolambe,
						Gurpur, Addur villages are covered under the area of Gurpur Parish. To
						describe the parish geographically, the area of the parish is covered
						with a number of fields and hills. To the south of the parish flows the
						Gurpur River.
					</p>
					<p class="mt-4 text-justify font-poppins text-lg text-slate-700">
						Before the existence of the Gurpur parish, the families living in
						this locality belonged to Fezar parish. After Ferar became a parish
						in 1912, the people from Gurpur went to Ferar Church for the
						Eucharistic celebration and also for the spiritual benefits. The
						number of people was doubling every year and there was an urgent
						need for new parishes to take care of such rapid growth in
						population.
					</p>
					<p class="mt-4 text-justify font-poppins text-lg text-slate-700">
						On 7th October 1915, Parish Priest of Ferar <strong
							>Rev. Fr. Reginald Pinto</strong
						> laid a foundation for a chapel. The building of the chapel was said
						to be completed by <strong>Fr. Joseph M. Menezes</strong> and blessed
						by <strong>Rt. Rev. Bishop Paul Ferini S.J.</strong> on October 29, 1918.
						In the Diocese of Mangalore, only this parish was dedicated to <strong
							>Our Lady of Pompei</strong
						>. A holy picture of the image of Our Lady of Pompei was brought
						from a city called Pompei in Italy, and is being honored in this
						parish. Because of the number of miracles and goodness of Our Lady
						of Pompei, the barren Kowdur has blossomed like a beautiful garden
						in God’s vineyard.
					</p>
					<p class="mt-4 text-justify font-poppins text-lg text-slate-700">
						<strong>Rev. Fr. Antony A. Colaco (1921-22):</strong> Gurpur became an
						independent parish on May 8, 1921. Fr. Anthony A. Colaco was appointed
						as the first parish priest of the newly constituted parish of Our Lady
						of Pompei. During his time, he opened a primary school for the poor and
						needy people of the parish in 1922.
					</p>
					<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg text-slate-700">
						<strong>Rev. Fr. F.X. Nazreth (1922-30):</strong> He was a convincing
						preacher of God’s word. During his time, he built a church façade using
						Goan design. In 1925, the church compound wall was built, and in 1929,
						a church bell was placed on the façade, which was brought from Goa.
					</p>
					<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg text-slate-700">
						<strong>Rev. Fr. Raphel Pinto (1930-33):</strong> Rev. Fr. Nazreth was
						succeeded by Rev. Fr. Raphel Pinto. In 1931, he constructed a parochial
						house. In 1933, Rev. Fr. Antony F. Covelho and Rev. Fr. Denis Mathias
						served the church.
					</p>
					<p class="mt-4 text-justify text-lg text-slate-700">
						<strong>Rev. Fr. Aveline Rebello (1933-40):</strong> Fr. Aveline Rebello
						instituted a wooden artistic altar of the Blessed Mother, which was donated
						by Hospet Church and carved in the Goan style. It was erected in the
						center of the church in October 1933. On April 2, 1934, he erected a
						huge cross on the hill in remembrance of the 150 years of Tipu’s captivity
						of the Christians. This cross is said to be visible from a long distance
						even today, reflecting the Christian symbol. In 1937, a portico was added
						to the parish building.
